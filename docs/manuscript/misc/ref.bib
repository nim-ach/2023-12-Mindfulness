abstract = {Objetivo
El presente estudio fue diseñado para evaluar las características psicométricas del Inventario de Ansiedad Beck (BAI) en una muestra de envejecidos puertorriqueños. Para esto se establecieron los siguientes objetivos: 1) evaluar la prevalencia de ansiedad en dicha muestra, 2) evaluar la consistencia interna del inventario y 3) realizar un análisis de estructura factorial del BAI.
Material Y Método
El BAI y la planilla demográfica se administraron a una muestra de 150 personas entre las edades de 60 a 99 años. De éstos, 100 participantes residen en égidas del área metropolitana de Puerto Rico y 50 en la comunidad de la misma región. El concepto de égidas ha sido definido por la Oficina de Asuntos de la Vejez del Gobierno de Puerto Rico como lugar de residencia multi-pisos de ancianos funcionales.
Resultados
Los resultados indicaron: 1) que un 28,9% de la muestra mostró síntomas de ansiedad entre moderados y severos según medido por el BAI, 2) que el BAI mostró tener una alta consistencia interna según el coeficiente alfa de Cronbach (0,94) y 3) que la composición factorial del BAI se modifica a tres factores en una muestra de envejecidos puertorriqueños.
Conclusiones
Los resultados obtenidos sugieren que el BAI, en castellano, es un instrumento adecuado para medir ansiedad en ancianos puertorriqueños. Además, presentan la necesidad de investigar más a fondo la prevalencia y sintomatología de la ansiedad en dicha población.
Objective
This present study was designed to evaluate the psychometric characteristics of the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Spanish Version BAI-SV), in order to increase the knowledge on older adults living in independent housing projects for the elderly and in the community in Puerto Rico. To do so, the following objectives were established: 1) evaluate the internal consistency of the sample, 2) evaluate the internal consistency of the instrument and 3) carry out an analysis of the factorial structure the BAI.
Material and Methods
The BAI-SV and the demographic inventory were administered to a sample of 150 individuals ranging in age from 60 to 99 years. From this sample, 100 participants were living in residential housing for functional older adults in the metropolitan area of Puerto Rico and 50 lived in the community in the same region. The concept of residential housing was defined by the Puerto Rico Governor's Office of Elderly Affairs as a place of multi-apartment residence for the functional elderly.
Results
The results indicated that: 1) 28.9% of the sample were experiencing moderate to severe levels of anxiety as measured by the BAI-SV, and 2) the instrument demonstrated high internal consistency according to the alpha coefficient of Cronbach (0.9456) and 3) the factorial makeup of the BAI is modified to a 3 factor model in a sample of aged Puerto Rican adults.
Conclusions
The results obtained suggest that the BAI in the Spanish version is an adequate instrument to measure anxiety in elderly Puerto Ricans. In addition, they present the need to investigate the prevalence and symptomatology of anxiety in this population further.}
